<h1>Count characters in CotEditor on Mac</h1>

<p>CotEditor has a feature to live-count characters in the document during editing.</p>


<h2>Standard character count</h2>

<p>CotEditor can show the character count both in the status bar and the document inspector.</p>

<p>The standard character count counts each grapheme cluster, which is defined as the “extended grapheme cluster” in Unicode. A grapheme cluster is a sequence of one or more Unicode code points that should be treated as a single unit for humans. For instance, while a normal character, such as A, is naturally counted as one character, an emoji consisting of multiple Unicode code points, such as 1️⃣ (<code>U+0031</code> <code>U+FE0F</code> <code>U+20E3</code>), is also counted as one character.</p>


<h2>Advanced character count</h2>

<p>From the Advanced Character Count command in the Text menu, you can count characters in various ways.</p>

<p>When starting the advanced character count, the counter appears at the bottom of the editor. The counter live-counts the characters in the way you set it in the advanced character count option dialog. While a part of the text is selected in the editor, the counter shows the number of the selected characters; otherwise, it indicates the number of the entire character in the document. You can drag the counter to put it out of the way.</p>
<p>The options are shared in the application. When you change the options in an editor, the way they are counted in other editors also changes.</p>

<p>Note that the advanced character count can affect the processing performance according to the combination of the settings, especially when the document to count has a large size. To stop the count, choose the Stop Advanced Character Count command in the Text menu.</p>
